        <p>College: the notorious time of last-minute studying and endless procrastination. Students often find themselves pressed for time, fighting against deadlines and a lack of sleep.</p>

        <p>Here an elegant solution presents itself in the form of Utopia: making planning ahead enjoyable. By using a game with built-in agenda features, students gain the opportunity to become both more organized and less stressed.</p>
        <p>Without the need to worry about remembering to meet project due dates alone, Utopia will provide an ideal support system for every college student with a hectic schedule.</p>

        <p>However, the application does not end at students: professionals can also benefit from the app's reminder feature, as well as organizing important events (like those important meetings for work or family), becoming more organized and less stressed as a result.</p>
